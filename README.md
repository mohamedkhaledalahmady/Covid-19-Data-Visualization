# Covid-19-Data-Visualization
> About Project
  * The goal of this project to visualizes COVID-19 pandemic data. The data (obtained from the Coronavirus Resource Center at the Johns Hopkins University as a (.mat)       file. 
  * I use MATLAB GUIDE for this project, and GUI interface has many options can cunclued in following
    * List box 1 --> showing all available countries and first element is **Global** for visualize data Globaly (of all counteris)
    * List box 2 --> showing all states of the currently selected country, with first option always **ALL**, and as most countries do not have states, regions,                                 territories or provinces.
    * Data_Plot group buttons --> to select what to plot: cases, deaths, or both (which means plot cases and deaths in same figure with 2 y-axis with difrrenet scals)
    * Options group buttons --> to select whether to plot cumulative data or daily numbers, and our database contains cumulative data, so part of our task to calculate                                   daily data
